# TODO: load the brightness data

# TODO: make a plot of brightness data vs time (analagous to red stars in orbit plot)

# TODO: load the posterior values

# TODO: for each set of orbital parameters (e.g. semimajor axis, eccentricity, etc)
# calculate the expected brightness at each data point's time  
# (using orbitize's code to compute brightness)

# TODO: for each set of predicted brightnesses, add to the plot (analagous to the grey lines in the orbit plot)

# flow of logic: [sma, ecc, inc, ...] -> orbit -> brightness vs time -> [brightness1(time 1), brightness2(time 2), ...]
